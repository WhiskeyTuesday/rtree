# Rtree
## A tree-like program in rust with line counts

I threw this together very quickly (with LLM help, admittedly).
It has bugs that I haven't chased. If you call it on a large enough nested
directory tree it will eventually panic, but it works well enough for me so I
haven't been motivated to fix it. PRs welcome.
